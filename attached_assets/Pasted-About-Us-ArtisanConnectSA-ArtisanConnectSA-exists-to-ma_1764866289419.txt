About Us – ArtisanConnectSA

ArtisanConnectSA exists to make one thing simple: connecting skilled artisans with people who need reliable workmanship.

Across South Africa, homeowners and businesses struggle to find trusted, verified tradespeople. At the same time, talented artisans often battle to find consistent job opportunities. We built ArtisanConnectSA to solve both problems.

Our platform gives customers an easy way to find, compare, and hire vetted artisans, while giving artisans a fair, transparent place to showcase their skills, receive job leads, and grow their businesses.

Whether you’re a contractor looking for quality work or a customer needing a plumber, painter, electrician, carpenter, or any other craftsperson — you’ll find them here.

Our vision is simple:
A safer, smarter, and more connected marketplace for South African artisans and the people who rely on them.

If you value reliability, transparency, and craftsmanship, you are in the right place.
